visit to Porto Latchi was a mixed experience. While the restaurant boasts a beautiful location with stunning views of the sea, especially if you manage to snag a table on the waterfront, the quality of the food and overall dining experience left much to be desired.\n\nStarting with the positives, the Greek salad was fresh and enjoyable, providing a decent start to the meal. Unfortunately, it was downhill from there. Our main courses consisted of carbonara and truffle ravioli, both of which were underwhelming. The carbonara was passable, but nothing to write home about. The real disappointment, however, was the truffle ravioli. Not only was the portion size shockingly small, but the ravioli itself was bland, and the accompanying sauce was far too heavy and stodgy, detracting from what should have been a more refined dish.\n\nAdditional issues included the bread, which tasted old and stale, and the precut limes served with our meal were dried out and still had sand on them.

Every dish we ordered was fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented. The grilled meats were perfectly cooked, and the seafood was incredibly fresh. The mezze selection was diverse and gave us a true taste of traditional Cypriot cuisine, with each dish tasting better than the last.\n\nThe atmosphere at Moustakallis is charming and authentic, with a lively yet relaxed vibe. It’s the kind of place that makes you feel at home while enjoying top-quality food.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Moustakallis to anyone visiting Paphos.

It was edible but that doesn't mean I could eat it. We also order the mixed grill, same side options. I am not even sure If food was cooked on charcoal and not in the oven, pan, and then at something else just to take the brown lines on the meat. Also our glasses were extremely dirty all four of them from waiters dirty hands and one of them had food stains too. I have to mention that the three women at the next table ate nothing of their food and they asked for the bill several times. The service was ok not perfect. Tourists this is not a place to try traditional dishes. Not recommended at all.\nI am happy to see your answer below!\nI have to mention that I come from a family of professional cooks and also my husband is a chef.

They were cold in the middle, soggy and had no flavor at all - despite the rancid oil... The side salad had no dressing or any sort of liquid/spice on at all.

The restaurant boasts stunning sea views that added a delightful backdrop to our meal.

The highlight of our dining experience was undoubtedly the shrimps in an amazing sauce. The flavors were exceptional and this dish truly left a lasting impression.\n\nFor our main course, we ordered the sea bass. While not overly extravagant, it was cooked perfectly and showcased the freshness of the seafood. The ambiance of Periyiali Restaurant is relaxed, fitting in perfectly with its beach bar setting. This is not a place for luxury, but rather a spot where you can enjoy good food in a casual atmosphere.\n\nOne of the most appealing aspects of this restaurant is its fair prices. The prices were reasonable and in line with what one would expect from a beach bar.\n\nAll in all, I would rate Periyiali Restaurant four stars.

Ordered a mixed seafood plate and only the fish seemed to be fresh. All the other stuff was made from mirelite and the waiter said that they are of course frozen as they are on the whole island. (Really??) It was shocking me a bit, but later it was more shocking, that all these seafood has the same grease taste. Not any own taste, only this greasy, disgusting-same-taste as it would be made in the same dish in very used grease.\nDuring our meal we were constantly fighting with bees and flies coming around and into the plate.\nAfter this (don't know why...) but still asked for a coffee and ice cream. It was so much time to get it. Ice cream was forgotten first time, after we had to go to the bar to choose them as it was easier for the waiter to go with him as to remember that 5-6 ice cream names that they were serving overall.\nAt least they accept cards payment."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMIU31C1sBKKnDA0XnF8dP7NdDueRRf9WKlXEbw""],""When"":""2019-9-7""},{""Name"":""Amanda French"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKFSlOnMclInhLPYpx2eYgDyjtxyXi8vWit6F73nuqvBQGaGg=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Lovely dining terraces and some facilities for children (bouncy castle/boat) I am a solo female traveller and although when I said I wanted a table for one the disappointment was a little obvious I will forgive them for this as both the food and service were exemplary from then on.

When they came to collect plates once we were finished they checked everything was ok and we explained that only 1 slice of pizza was eaten but that it wasn’t any fault of the restaurant and we asked for the bill. When the bill came the waiter explained that they had removed the pizza from the bill as it hadn’t been to our taste which I thought was more than they needed to do and was very generous. The only reason for not giving a full house of 5 stars was because of the wait when we first arrived to order drinks."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipN_7n5ODkcJkDugRfOnxJ28PmsqPp8KixqL2WU""],""When"":""2023-8-28""}]",

At night it's only meze you have no other options. The meze was 28 euro. (They don't have a menu so you couldn't see anywhere written that is 28 euros, also they don't inform you when you call to book a table that it's only meze and they mention nothing about the price. )\n\nSo I had high expectations. Salad with some little plates came out very quickly. I was impressed with all of the starters especially with the salad and the chick bean dip. But after that I was a bit disappointed.\n\nThey said it was a meat meze but they just served pork souvla (the cheapest meat you can get in the market) overcooked and dry. And pork souvlakia (again pork...) overcooked also.  Chicken giro, was just ok. So basically the meat meze was just pork. That doesn't excuse the 28 euro per person. I was expecting something different. Also all the meat was high on salt. Also another disappointment is that they offer you nothing at the end, like fruit or something sweet. It's the first time in my life that I went to a meze restaurant and they didn't offer something at the end.\n\nPositives:  The great service the atmosphere and the starters. I asked if they changed the menu from time to time. And they said no. So there is no reason to visit this place again if you have nothing else to offer.\n\nService 9/10\nAtmosfere 10/10\nStarters 9/10\nSalad 10/10\nWine: 8/10\nMeat meze 5/10\n\nHopefully my honest review will help you with something."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPT8DRe7UPkL8nh9MIjb9PqSYUdsn7OVjIQLhrz""],""When"":""2024-9-1""},{""Name"":""Bartosz Glowacki"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLu65ox7c2jmCEYEH8CfTaMGnKel2jAxTiJiUHKQH8A92-EUQ=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I really loved this place and the authentic food. the atmosphere is eclectic mix of styles, mix of new and old interiors.

And boy, this place did not disappoint! Ben the owner was remarkably friendly, warm, and welcoming. I walked in not quite knowing what to expect, but the food we had on the first night was sensational. After eating the amazing meze selection consisting of a mix of traditional dishes including pies, meats, salads, and vegetables, I was supremely confident this place could rank highly among the best eateries in town.\n\nThe outdoor atmosphere (as pictured) was so pleasant we ended up staying a little longer after closing time to drink some wine and chat to Ben. Ben explained that the restaurant is family run and had been open for 30 years. He also explained that some of their ingredients are sourced from his family’s farm. And judging by the quality and taste of the food, you could tell that it was made with care, love, and patience. I absolutely LOVE food, both cooking it and eating it, so I decided to pick his brains on the history of some of the dishes they served us, and oh boy, Ben did not disappoint. This guy knows his stuff, and I could see and hear his passion for food as he spoke.\n\nMy first visit was such an enjoyable experience, I decided to come back on my birthday 2 days later to have dinner. And you know what; it was even better the second time. Like I said, I LOVE food, especially when it's made with quality ingredients, and I can enjoy it in non-pretentious surroundings. St. George's Tavern absolutely surpassed my expectations and was my absolute favourite restaurant during my trip. I ate out a lot and although there was some very good competition, this place won by a country mile. There is no 'instagrammy' flower wall, or garish lighting, or any pretence. Instead, the restaurant has a rustic aesthetic and charm and just serves excellent food in a pleasant relaxed environment.\n\nThe place was busy both times I went but we luckily managed to get a table with ease on each visit. Out of respect for fellow diners, I chose not take pictures while the place was full. But hopefully you can see from my pictures how lovely this place truly is! If you’re in Paphos, YOU MUST EAT HERE, I confidently say that you won’t be disappointed! And TBH, I already know that I’ll be eating here a few more times when I go back to Paphos.\n\nIf you see this Ben, thanks again to you and your guys!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNJtVL_PgDIuquAuSZgMGL4hl0TIVsfR_a3jib_""],""When"":""2023-11-13""}]",

It’s definitely must to try.\n- Lamb tsiagariasto with bulgur - the combination of very soft and tasty mean with little bit spicy bulgur, yummy.\n- pasta with octopus - is very delicious.\n- Traditional Cypriot desert - it was a little bit sweet for us, but it should be like this.\n\nThe menu is like a children's book with lots of pictures of the dishes and a good description. Couldn't help noticing :)\n\nOn weekends this restaurant is full of customers, especially at lunchtime, so the waiters are very busy and may not pay much attention to you. But if you come on a weekday, they will talk to you, discuss the weather and give you another dessert as a compliment from the establishment. At least that's how it was for us :)\n\nThe restaurant is located near Finikoudes.  On weekends, there are a lot of visitors here and everyone around enjoys the food.  It smells delicious in here.

One of the best meals we’ve ever eaten in Cyprus (coming from a British Cypriot). Kazani is an old traditional Cypriot home that has been converted into a family run restaurant-taverna in the village of Aradippou, not far from Larnakas. We were blown away by the service of our waitress (who was also the daughter of the owner) and by the quality of the fresh homemade food prepared by her brother. She gave us some brain teaser game-puzzles to complete while we were finishing our drinks and chatting — hilarious watching the table next to us try to figure them out after us. Felt very homely and chill. If you’re staying nearby this place is not worth missing out on. We noticed a good amount of locals (a universally good sign) but also many tourists which made us feel very proud that they experienced true Cypriot food and hospitality. The owner is very visible and regularly walked around the restaurant to check on his guests. He even invited us for a coffee on his veranda back at his home. 10/10 recommend. We were 4 people and ordered meat mezze for 3, we even managed to take some home with us. The fact you can look around upstairs and get a snapshot of Cyprus life in the days of old is a really nice touch. Also my KEO beer was the coldest I’ve ever had in this country - they have a special beer fridge was just sublime. Sitting outside is definitely preferable on a hot summers evening and we were told it’s busy most days, so you must call to book.. If they’re full ask to go on their cancellation list which is how we managed to get a last minute table (on a Monday night)."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipMkYVGfj5dwIVXF45S8sHk0FxBmFoWx3Bp1oXs_""],""When"":""2024-9-18""},{""Name"":""Nadia Khalil"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXBdcCUB-A2FVSTUdmmvlzSrvFfcghY2Ok5hV8ptdZYs5ohMf4U=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""I went on a Thursday night with my friends for dinner.

It was edible but that doesn't mean I could eat it. We also order the mixed grill, same side options. I am not even sure If food was cooked on charcoal and not in the oven, pan, and then at something else just to take the brown lines on the meat. Also our glasses were extremely dirty all four of them from waiters dirty hands and one of them had food stains too.

visit to Porto Latchi was a mixed experience. While the restaurant boasts a beautiful location with stunning views of the sea, especially if you manage to snag a table on the waterfront, the quality of the food and overall dining experience left much to be desired.\n\nStarting with the positives, the Greek salad was fresh and enjoyable, providing a decent start to the meal. Unfortunately, it was downhill from there. Our main courses consisted of carbonara and truffle ravioli, both of which were underwhelming. The carbonara was passable, but nothing to write home about. The real disappointment, however, was the truffle ravioli. Not only was the portion size shockingly small, but the ravioli itself was bland, and the accompanying sauce was far too heavy and stodgy, detracting from what should have been a more refined dish.\n\nAdditional issues included the bread, which tasted old and stale, and the precut limes served with our meal were dried out and still had sand on them. This lack of attention to detail was disappointing. Considering all these shortcomings, the meal was also highly overpriced. We ended up paying €41 for just these dishes and a bottle of water, which did not seem justified given the quality and portion sizes.\n\nIn summary, while Porto Latchi might offer a pleasant view, the food quality, portion sizes, and pricing leave much to be desired. It's not a place we would recommend based on my experience, especially if you're looking for value for your money and a satisfying meal."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOtcd3D-PqfQjxGTshIwFE_8H4Eg8nsQsH7Au1N""],""When"":""2024-9-3""},{""Name"":""Fobby"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKzGcHq55PwqCR6ckTH2kG2vKn5hRjLM6KtoryYYNwMVC6kOQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""The restaurant is on both sides of the street, on one side you have a more formal setting and the other side nearest the beach is for more relaxed dinning.

Other tourists who arrived 10 minutes after us were served before us, which was frustrating!\n\nThe food was average at best, and some dishes were disappointing. I definitely do not recommend the calamari rings—they were soggy, slimy, and simply unappetizing. The fish, octopus, and shrimp were fine. However, the fries were drenched in oil, making them incredibly greasy and ruining their taste.\n\nFor starters, we ordered tahini, fish roe spread (twice), and pita bread. This was the one thing I can’t criticize—it was all good. The pork souvlaki that my friend ordered was below average: burnt on the outside, raw on the inside, and poorly seasoned.\n\nOn the plus side, after the meal, we were given complimentary dessert—a cake that tasted very good—and a traditional strong Cypriot spirit. However, another negative was the service after the meal. We wanted to pay, asked the waiter for the bill, and had to wait another 15-20 minutes to receive it.\n\nWe left the restaurant with mixed feelings."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNNUZaC-bJwpYk4XW0xBODnC-3yKwIJ5eMv-heX""],""When"":""2024-9-8""},{""Name"":""Troy"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLDmdn5TAaDGgfmoaGAmC8BcbSwGPGbvkdPgJX-EduyuBYmpg=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Our favourite restaurant whilst visiting Cyprus!\nA small, beautiful, family run, authentic restaurant down a quiet road with spot on service and amazing food.

Meanwhile, a table closer to the water became available and they were happy for us to move. When our drinks arrived 1 of the 4 was missing and this was quickly rectified. When the food arrived it was delicious - Chicken Baguette, Fish and chips, Kids chicken nuggets. The final meal - the kids Margarita pizza wasn’t to our child’s liking as it came with actual slices of tomato on it 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️.  When they came to collect plates once we were finished they checked everything was ok and we explained that only 1 slice of pizza was eaten but that it wasn’t any fault of the restaurant and we asked for the bill. When the bill came the waiter explained that they had removed the pizza from the bill as it hadn’t been to our taste which I thought was more than they needed to do and was very generous. The only reason for not giving a full house of 5 stars was because of the wait when we first arrived to order drinks."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipN_7n5ODkcJkDugRfOnxJ28PmsqPp8KixqL2WU""],""When"":""2023-8-28""}]",

For just €50.00, we enjoyed a complete meal.\n\nThe platters were filled with a delightful variety of grilled meats, including two pork souvlaki skewers, two chicken souvlaki skewers, two chicken kebab skewers, one pork kebab skewer, and two pieces of chicken-bacon rolls. They were served with tzatziki, mustard sauce, Mama salad, and crispy fried potatoes. The dishes were flavorful and diverse, perfectly balanced with the sauces and side dishes.\n\nFrom the outside, the restaurant appears to have a traditional restaurant ambiance, but inside, the concept is more akin to self-service or fast food. This might be surprising, but it does not detract from the quality of the food.\n\nPiatsa Gourounaki Express is located on Leoforos Kostaki Pantelidi, near the central Eleftheria Square, making it a convenient spot for visitors to the city looking for a delicious, authentic Greek meal without too much fuss."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipO_Z9c3RtynRugk6NIPznOF_zG0-Ao4pAX8ZzCB""],""When"":""2024-8-8""},{""Name"":""Vasilios Moschos"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJOzKsTKq1goOe0XYuWKBwkBMPyETZzX4E5LXTEDfWhFw0noA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""It is a nice place, serving greek food, placed in the center of Nicosia opposite the Eleutherias Square.The  food was good, prepared in front of you with fresh ingredients.

The staff is always sweet and attentive, and the owner is a great and personable guy who often checks up on the restaurant and his customers.

Not dry at all.\n\nThe lamb pieces on a skewer, very nice and succulent. Melt in your mouth feel. Not chewy at all.\n\nNakanek was good. A bit pricy.\n\nThe spinach dumplings were very good. Hot and fresh.\n\nThe arayes with zaatar not to be recommended at all.\nThe hummus with the minced meat was hummus with fatty and chewy pieces of meat.

Atmosphere and environment really nice! So was the music! All the staff was very gentle and nice, except the girl in the entrance, who is the reason of my 4 stars rating instead of 5 stars. We were guests of the hotel and we decided to try the rooftop restaurant. Asked at the reception before and no reference was made about dress code or reservation needed. When we arrived, we were asked if we have a reservation, giving us the impression its fully booked. She then found a table for us but then she looked at our shoes and said she is not sure we can go in. Since we are in casual vacation and didnt really think of it, we were wearing sandals. The girl asked the manager who happily and gently told us there is no problem and led us to our table. The restaurant by the time we left was half full. But what really bothered us was when my 4 years old daughter went to look at the view at the glass barrier, the same girl complained that she is leaving fingerprints. Our daughter had just touched the glass with her clean hands. I found her whole attitude not matching the very nice and relaxing atmosphere of the restaurant. While everyone else was super nice, she made us stressed and took us a while to relax and enjoy it.\nP.s. half of the people in the restaurant were wearing flip flops and sandals, which is the most expected and understandable thing to see in a steakhouse of a big seaside all inclusive style family resort, where people go to relax with their family and not to dress up formally."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Kelly L"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUD4h3edafmtrOaHJ70vs4WzED_sZvz9Eb35fiLqE-h8z7pB6WDdQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Great fine dining experience with lovely staff and the food was delicious and not forgetting the cocktails!\n\nSalmon starter, was well seasoned with a citrus kick to it.

You are immediately surrounded by complete luxury when you enter the restaurant, and then the hostess and especially the general manager Clio and his staff are superb and everything is first class from there onward.\nWhen it comes to food, everything is beautifully prepared and presented, our group of 7 people had an array of starters from mussels, rugula with goat cheese ball, foie gras, ravioli, you name it.... totally an awesome experience.\nThen for main, highly recommend the Chateaubriand  steak. It melts in your mouth.\nTo complement your meal a large selections of local wines that are totally worth a try.\nIn my opinion, the desert menu could have a larger selection, perhaps including some local delicacies.\nThis is definitely the place to take that special someone for food and an overall experience to remember for a long time.our last visit at Glasshouse was on 29 August 2024. The restaurant has undergone a complete makeover. There is an outside area with breathtaking views of Nissi Beach and Agia Napa. The food menu has also been updated. I highly recommend the rack of lamb, simply cooked to perfection. The food and the atmosphere was once again complemented by Clio, the manager of the restaurant. Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area, you will not be disappointed."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipPD9H5sA-jp2Rcmqny4Ixpy2f2AY8gp7NsA402O""],""When"":""2024-8-30""}]",

It was delicious. We also ordered the house white wine which paired perfectly with the seafood. Spyros then offered us TWO MORE complimentary glasses. He then insisted to show us the dessert offerings, so he brought the plates over to us and we chose the baklava / cheesecake hybrid with a vanilla ice cream scoop.

From the starters to the main courses, each plate was prepared with great attention to detail and bursting with flavor. While it’s hard to pick a standout dish, that’s only because everything we tried was exceptional.\nWhat truly sets Gardens apart, though, is the service. The staff was incredibly pleasant and accommodating, and by the end of our stay, they felt more like friends than servers. They even surprised us with complimentary drinks, a gesture that made our experience all the more special.\nThe crowd at Gardens typically consists of groups of friends and families, making it a lively yet relaxed place to enjoy a meal or drinks.

As a restaurant culture ambassador never witnessed service like that.

And then fun started as we finished starters even after very long time main dishes were not served. After 40 minutes of waiting after starters we left. As I mentioned to personal couple of times on the issue - they just told that other families finished their dinner only because they didn’t get starters. But having a pause between starters and main more than 40 minutes that is something I never witnessed in a very long time.\n\nHowever kid zone is a nice idea for restaurant and still soup was great, just very sad that we didn’t received other main dishes although I think they would be great - but some staff training would be nice for a next season."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""}]",

For dessert we shared the Tiramisu and Creme Brûlée - not the best puddings I’ve ever had but tasty and again, decent sized portions. Very friendly staff. The only reason I didn’t give it a 5/5 is because unfortunately we were seated under a tree which must have a bird or bat living in it because our menus and my head were pooped on, which was a shame and I understand this is somewhat out of the restaurants control but it did slightly taint our experience!

We had Moussaka that was forgettable. It tasted unfortunately more like an Italian lasagne.\n\nThe Moussaka at Kota Greek Tavern is the best we had in Ayia Napa. We wanted to try at Tonys Taverna as well to compare and the difference was huge.\n\nIt took a while for the food to arrive, even if it was not that crowded. They didnt even know who had ordered what, so the waitress visited two other tables with the food before heading back to the kitchen and then finally came to us, which was a bit funny.\n\nSo if you want a beautiful scenery then go for it, but dont expect the Moussaka to be something to come back for. We also had the lamb chops, which were grilled too long so it became rather rubbery. Price vs food quality didnt match, but i assume they can be pricier because of the decor."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipNMJ8GTDOA7J_ZwPSsijFaIGTHvWxK13oGplHTD""],""When"":""2024-4-19""}]",

Beautiful trees, fountains, fish pond with at least 20 koi fish, ventilation for every table, garden and flowers (I'll attach pics as well so you can see with your own eyes).\n\n1) Serving:\nThe 3 waiters that have served us did a fantastic job. 1st one guided us to the table and communicated with us, 2nd waiter took our order very professionally, understanding of our wishes and tastes and was very involved in our experience from start to end, 3rd waiter came with the food mostly as a helper for 2nd but from my perspective this means unity and helpfulness which I appreciate very much.\n\nThey all did a great job from start to end, if I could rate 10 stars out of 5, I would do it specially for the serving, but that's not all!\n\n2) Drinks:\nThe order came very fast for 2 cocktails, but man I must admit I have drunk the best strawberry margaritas in here. They were appreciated and delicious.\n\n3) Food:\nWell, if the serving made me want to give 10 stars out of 5, the food gave me the energy and patience to write such a long feedback. The food was so wonderful, my tongue is still dancing tango from the aromas (and im 30mins on the road already).\n\nOrder Beef Stifado if you want your tongue to dance tango as well. The taste is very special, strong and delicious. I've ate this meal before, indeed, nothing special at first glance, until you take that first bite then you are transported into another universe full of taste and aromas.\n\n4) CATS!!! The lovely black cat will let you pet and love her but you know the tax... (Cheese, meat, fish)\n\nIn conclusion, if you're looking for an amazing experience, food, drink and serving while you gaze around at beautiful decorations, flowers, fish pond etc, go to Les Amis you will be delighted.\n\nP.S: don't worry about the prices, they are good (and worthy if thats the case)"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipN5Ep_LKKQi9Xk6G0e-HwtGqfCIzLHjd3PXWPlC""],""When"":""2024-6-24""},{""Name"":""Máté Habán"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLRePi-IEnrZKubMx-wzWzDCrcc7nZUINcukjwbNoRV-PAizw=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""The reviews led us to this restaurant, and we were not disappointed—so much so that we ended up having our last dinner of the trip here as well.

reviews, we decided to visit this restaurant, but a series of disappointments began as soon as we arrived.\n\nWe came as a couple and after being seated, we noticed a different approach towards groups of three or more compared to couples. Faster service, better communication.\n\nAnother issue was that the menu listed all drinks except non-alcoholic ones, and there were no side dishes mentioned either.\n\nSo much time passed between our drinks being brought and our food order being taken that we could have ordered another drink. (We even considered moving to another restaurant.)\n\nIn the end, we gave it a chance and ordered food and another drink.\n\nWhen the drinks arrived, our previous glass was left on the table (although this is a minor detail, it emphasized the following issues for us).\n\nAfter a long wait, we received our food, but we didn't know what surprises awaited us...\n\nMy girlfriend: the meat was under-seasoned (not even salted) + the fries were bland and very greasy (the fries at the bottom were soggy from the oil).\n\nMe: the chicken with Parmesan turned out to be eggplant with a few grams of chicken and the side dish? A potato that wasn’t even seasoned (we would have expected at least butter to soften it/salt) but maybe we were expecting too much...\n\n+ we were attended to by three waitstaff\n(1.

Nevertheless, overall the starters, mains and desserts were outstanding and the presentation was a candy to the eyes. I just wished a bit more explanation what I had on a plate. There was a burst of flavours and colours with my scallops but I ended up guessing some of the flavours.  My husband opted for the ribeyed steak and he found it being a bit like braised version than standard seared one. It was tasty but maybe not what he expected. One of the kids chose pizza and the cheese was too strong for being a kids menu item. However, overall the dining experience was lovely - the food and presentation combined . The wine was delicious, the port was lovely and a complimentary  strawberry limoncello was a cherry on a top.
